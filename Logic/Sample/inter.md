## 2. PROJECT PRESENTAION E-COMMERCE
i created Fammsstore application.its my first project.
this is an e-commerce application which i built to sell cloths in online,
i am a mern stack developer so i used the stack node.js for backend and express on the top of it as aframe work.since it is very fast and it has been used lots of e-commerce application.so i thougtthatwould be a great fit for my project.and for the database i used mongodb.its a non sql database.mongodboffers flexible schema,scalability,and powerfull query capability.and in frontend part i used hbs as a templete engine.handlebars is a lightwight templete engine used in javscript.and i used bootstrap forstyling in my application.
like i said its a e-commerece application you can expect almost all feature from an ecommerce application as well.like cart,whishlist,product detailpage,payment,authentication using cookie and session,and checkoutetc..i have intigreated payment gateway using razorpay
i have added the feature that coupen and wallet.
if user return a product after purchasing in razorpay online payment that amount will be refunded to thatuser wallet.and after that he can purchase product using that wallet price.

if user purchased product that worth more than 3000 rupees then he can use coupen.the coupen amount willbe deducted from total price.and coupen can use only once after that it will be expired.

the logic behid the cart is little more tough.i spent few days to complite cart in my application.
i have learned lots of things while building this project.and i had deal with lots of challenges whilecreatig this application.

when it came to the future of my project i would like to add some extra functionalities that mainly reviews and ratings. ratings for the products from user.so that can be easy to understand the quality of product.and also i would like to add shipment tracking and google signup.

## 24. CHALLENGING SITUATION FACED IN BUILDING THIS APPLICATION ##
While building this application, I had deals with lots of challenging situations,
particularly when it came to implementing real-time chat functionality and
handling the committee changing processes.

i created chat application using socket io.
Socket.IO is a library for real-time communication between a server and client.
It uses various transport methods to ensure a reliable connection. It provides
features like automatic reconnection and event-based messaging. It simplifies bidirectional communication
in web applications, making it easy to build interactive and responsive apps.

i have done quickly ui part and write api for message storing in database with userid reference
of userCollection ,clubId with reference of club collection and fetching
from database using populate user and showing in ui. but for making this real time i used
socket io. i installed socket io client and conected socet io in front and backend but also its has some
error in socet emit and on so i spent 2 days to complete my chat

This chat implementation utilizes Socket.IO for real-time communication. It establishes a Socket.IO client
connection to a server. Users can send messages via input fields, which are sent to the
server through HTTP requests and emitted using Socket.IO. Incoming messages trigger real-time
updates to all connected clients, ensuring instant chat interactions.
## 25. TIME MANAGEMENT ##
    "While working on my project  'I-Club,' my  key challenge was implementing real-time chat,
    a crucial feature with a tight deadline."

I encountered unexpected issues while integrating Socket.IO for real-time chat. This slowed progress.

To manage time effectively, I adjusted my schedule, giving more time to solve Socket.IO
problems while keeping other tasks on track."

 By adapting and finding  the issues, I successfully delivered the real-time chat feature on time.
