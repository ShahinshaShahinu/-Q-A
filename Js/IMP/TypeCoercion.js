// Type coercion in JavaScript 
// refers to the 
// automatic conversion of values from one data type to another.



// JavaScript, for example, performs type coercion in various scenarios, such as when using comparison
//  operators (==, ===), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), or logical operators (&&, ||).
